      <p class="students">I loved to shoot and edit video and showcase my stylistic taste and abilities. I chose the program knowing that not only will I be able to shine in that aspect, but I will also learn the industry standard skills and work ethic to dip my feet into a real world working environment. - Bobby Edmond</p>
      <p class="students">The reason why I was interested in IMD and decided to choose it as my program is because I have a passion for design and a sense of creativity. Video production and graphic designing are the two major career paths that I would like to peruse in the future and thought IMD would be a great way to prepare me for that. - Simran Virdee</p>
      <p class="students">I decided to join Interacrive Media Design because I enjoy design and video editing. - Nabih Fakih</p>
